# N-Body
 This is a project that simulates a Universe with N bodies. The original project was take from the case study in the book *Introduction to Programming in Java* by Robert Sedgewick and the original code can be found [here](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/34nbody/)
 
# Changes made from the original
- Changed the radius of the planets to be equal to the mass
- Made the planets bounce off the walls
- Added color values in the txt file so each planet could have a different color
- Added trails to the planets that got smaller.
- Planets make a sound when bouncing off the wall and now there is a looped background sound
